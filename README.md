# Hybrid-Baggage-Image-Labeling-and-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
A project for classifying and organizing baggage images using a hybrid approach. It combines manual image labeling with automated classification using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. Labeled images are used to train the model, which then predicts and organizes unlabeled images into predefined class folders.
